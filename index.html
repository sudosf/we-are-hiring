          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            We are a forward-thinking technology company dedicated to creating solutions nobody asked for but everyone
            suddenly depends on. Our teams thrive on high-pressure environments fueled by caffeine, imposter syndrome, and
            Git merge conflicts.

        <h2>Position Overview</h2>
        <p>
          We are seeking a software engineer who is passionate about problem-solving, allergic to boredom, and
          prepared to debate tabs vs. spaces as though civilization depends on it. The successful candidate will
          develop, debug and maintain systems that will, inevitably, need rewriting in the next quarter.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Translate vague business requirements into 700 lines of code and a single Jira ticket labeled "In Progress".
          </li>
          <li>
            Debug errors by googling the same Stack Overflow post repeatedly until enlightenment strikes.
          </li>

            Participate in code reviews by graciously insulting colleagues in a constructive tone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deliver features that work locally but explode spectacularly in production.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide technical explanations to non-technical stakeholders that sound like wizardry.

        <h2>Qualifications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Proficiency in at least one modern programming language (and guilt over not knowing 10 more).
          </li>
          <li>
            Strong problem-solving skills, especially when the “problem” is your own code from last week.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ability to work independently, yet still somehow attend 14 meetings a day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Excellent communication skills, including sighing loudly and typing passive-aggressive comments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent experience in Googling things.
          </li>

        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Competitive compensation so you can purchase more ergonomic chairs you’ll still slouch in.
          </li>

            Endless growth opportunities, mostly in your Git commit history.
          </li>

            A collaborative environment full of people pretending they understand Kubernetes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The exhilarating emotional rollercoaster of feeling like a genius and an imposter in rapid succession.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlimited coffee and the occasional pizza bribe during deployments.
