# We Are Hiring 👩‍💻☕

A totally professional, not-at-all sarcastic job posting page for a **Software Engineer**.  
Because nothing says "join our team" like a cool website, caffeine references, and subtle despair.

[APPLY NOW!](https://sudosf.github.io/we-are-hiring/)

## ✨ Features

- Clean, semantic HTML5 structure (no div soup, promise).
- Responsibilities, Qualifications, and Perks you may or may not survive.
- An "Apply Now" link that currently goes nowhere. Very exclusive.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone this repo and open `index.html` in your browser.  
That’s it. You’re now HR.

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests welcome, especially if they:

- Add more sarcastic perks.
- Fix typos that make us look less hireable.
- Replace the stock photo with something even faker.

## Disclaimer

 _We deploy at 3 a.m. for maximum authenticity 🌙._
